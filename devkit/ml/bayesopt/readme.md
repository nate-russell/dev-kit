# Off-Policy Evaluation for BO: Suragate Models + Aquisition Functions

releasing control to 


# Problem Settings
1. Start off with K samples of some unknown but consistent policy, we want to estimate wether or not switching policies is a good idea. real-world example: started experimenting with human expert plan, now wondering if it is time to switch to a different BO Policy for another K' samples
2. Same as 1 but we know the functional form of the sampling policy, maybe it was random or GP-UCB
